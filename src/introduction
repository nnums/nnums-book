# Introduction

The purpose of this book is to help me not waste my life.

What it means to waste your life probably has a different meaning to everyone.
But to me, from a career perspective, if I'm not learning and sharing and creating things, maybe I'm wasting that part of my life.
Also, if I'm completely ignoring science and engineering, I'm not living on the level I want to be living at.
And then there's probably the most interesting topic, which is how does one live well.
That will probably seep in here because I care about it but it may not be the focus.
