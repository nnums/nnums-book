# Coordinates

It's worth thinking about what observers from different inertial coordinate systems can agree on.
They don't agree on position.
We'll learn that they don't agree on times.
But they do agree on their relative velocity and in special relativity they do agree on the speed of light.
If two events happen at a particular time and place, they agree about the simultanaity of those events.

The ordering of events at a particular location should be agreed upon by all observers even if to one observer those events all took place at the same location
and to the other observer they did not.
