Last night I went on a walk to think about my life.
There are so many things to be grateful for --

- a good marriage to a wonderful wife.
- Four happy, healthy, impressive daughters and four happy, healthy, impressive sons.
- gorgeous weather and beautiful, walkable surroundings.
- some measure of financial security.
- a skill set that's in demand.
- interesting people around me to interact with, enjoy, and learn from.
- a good job with interesting work and good people and the opportunity to work flexibly from home.

But despite all of these things I was feeling panicky and frustrated.
And the reason was pretty clear -- life was passing by too quickly and it felt like, from a career perspective, I wasn't getting what I wanted to get done, done.

When I sat down and thought about what I want to get done, it wasn't too complicated:

- I want to write regularly.
- I want to write code for my own projects.
- I want to build and write things that I own.
- I want to go back to my roots in physics and biology and engineering.

So then there was just the question of how to make that practical.
The most practical thing, I think, is to make this book here and publish it.

So hello world!  And here goes!
