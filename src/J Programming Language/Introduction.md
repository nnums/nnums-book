# Introduction

I'm playing with J.
I may never use it practically speaking.
For practical use I've spent most of my career in either Maple, Mathematica, Matlab, Python, or Rust.

But when one day recently I was wanting some brain candy and I remembered all those extremely terse, cryptic solutions to Project Euler problems in J.

Anyway, there's a neat feeling that comes from making the cryptic clear, and that's what these notes on J are meant to do.
I'll get the double benefit, hopefully, of cementing in my mind what I just learned and then of having a reference to look back on in the future.  And maybe it will benefit you as well!
